\subsection{Introduction to Data Analytics: What is Data analytics}
\subsubsection{Data Science \& Data Analytics}
Product ownership - important to  if you are middle analyst   

ML: Data -> Algorithm -> Prediction 

Unsupervised Learning:
Include only one stage 

Supervised Learning:

Model (Trainable parameters)
With comparing results with prediction 
Model(Fixed parameters) 
Comparing results -> Effectiveness of model 

Data for training and testing:

Hits: 
* Never mess up data from Train and Test data
* Train and test should have the same distribution

One of example is number recognition 
where Train data shouldn't be clear (e.g white on black background) and traain is messed up 

Algorithms:
1. Linear algotihms
2. Non-linear models

e.t.c.

Data Analytics is collection, transformation, and organisation of data

Data -> Mining -> Conclusions & Monitoring 

Tables, images, audio recording -> A/B split, data exploration -> Recommendations, predictions, dashboards


Instruments: 
1. Ide
* PyCharm 
* VSCode
* Jupyter
2. BI
* Tableau
* Redash
* Superset
* Power BI 
* e.t.c Plotly/ Dash/ Yandex DataLens
3. Knowledge
* Domain knowledge
* Product metrics
* SQL
* Python
* A/B split mechanics and statiscical test
* Classical ML
* Causal inference
* Excel 


Q&A:
Q: What is product ownership 
1. How to deepen Domain knowledge
2. Ideas to develop product 
3. Importans for domain knowledge 

A: 
Make your own decision
E.g all decisions came from analysts. If You lead you are also some kind of product owner 

1 and 2. Read what happens in industry Medium, Habr
Approach - effective process adhoch - 10-20 percent and 80 percent is new ml, da prosucts and live time for fantasy 

Feynman method - from childish ideas to something else 

Books: Insired table book for prosuct owner
Вы, конечно, шутите, Мистер Фейман

You need to tell, that you are building to improve your process. Add grouming - you need to think what problems your are taking - you need to leave placce for 

Good solution: Ask why you need that task: from one to five - better to prioritise 

Habr: Anton - delivery club, how to work with incoming tasks 

3. DS take part in both DA and ML part - he needs to know knowledge in  if he is not MLE or something like that  




Q Diff-to-diff:


A
Functionality that will help users get business value. 
Go it to prod faster, but A/B test should went 2 month - you can't use your functionality on all users. 
Make it on all product - all users, and than tell if It valuable or not after  
some period. Note that you shouldn't use it if you didn't get reed of seasonality 

Q ML minimum values in train 

A Empirically, but 0,8 on 0,2 and 0,7 on 0,3
Minimum is necessary, but more importantly it schooled represent general population if it classical ML. 
For NN use million objects

Q How to test importans of task 

A
RICE and ICE is good for prioritisation 

A leap of faith - 20 percent of 

Marti Cagan - inspired : Go from problem, but some problems isn't possible to estimate - just minimise that amount of problems 

\subsubsection{More about DA}


Speaker Anton Kerselyan:
MSU graduate 2016
2020 - Yandex Market - developing emerging 


Prior to Yandex thouth that analyst is someone who knows SQL and Python likes to poke around in data

1. Analysts is combunation of business and mathematics 
2. Competencesis
3. Business roles


In IT analytics is head nad hands of business, 
Support to business 
Yandex for example: 
Main analytical roles is:
1. Business Analyst
* Kind of business man
* Kind of good technical specialist:
    1. What SKU to use now
    2. Effectivness

2. Product Analyst
* A/B Test
* How to improve product 

What is analyst:
Strategy:
Metrics: You could compose metrics or just live 10 metrics(top metrics for users) 
Data:
Hypothesis(more product role)
Dashboards

What is needed:


Solid knowledge of math(especially statistics) 
Technically enthusiasm
Business thinking
An ability to  ask Why
Experience 

Intern is someone with good math and technical skills
Middle is something how generate aa lot of impact
Senior is something how give advises to CEO

Team lead: Generate analytical projects - need more ideas to make more 
Head of some analytics( CDO) 

Example: Top 100

Why? For Dark Store assortiment 
You improve metrics

Example:: Figure out optimal delivery radius 

Example: Manager come in and ask you to  evaluate effects of a new criteria ( if the phone is a second-hand one) on rate of the customers return to the service 

You understand that people change phones once a year or less, and you also see that the volume of use of the new criteria is quite low.


Example:
You find in data that some problem is accrued in user experience 


Q & A

Q Operaation analytics:

A: Logistics analyst 

You need have math base and useful to know about modeling 


QA What about modeling:

\subsection{Key Metrics and Analysis: Product & Marketing}

A few words about the lecturer 

Education: Bauman BE Biomedical/Medical Engeneering

Palta, Senior Data Analyst, 2022 - now ( current)  
Yandex, Data Analyst 2019 - 2022

Metrics are a projection of values, of what's important, and numerically represented 

Commercial information about comapany:
Capitalization
Revenue
Profit
Growth rate

Government - for the life level of their citizens ( Why not liberty or something)
Tv shows - using ratings
Family cars - for reliability
Sports Cars - for speed and how cool you would look in it 

The same structures would act differently depending on what metrics is used 
* if scientist amount of researches
* amount of citations
* Hirch index (max amount of research with citation 

1. Masimise quantity minimise quality
2. Maximise quality minimise quantity - only looking for hype, for cornerstine
3. Perfect balance 



* Industry the students chose
* How support works
* The metric we designed 


Ground rule to design a metrics:

*Physical - physical process or object feature 
*Secure to the fraud 
*It schould be obvious in which way this metric should be changed in order for things to get better 

Other important ideas 

*When developing the system of metrics it is importaant to cver all major departments with minimum intersection between the metrics
* Metrics eqal teams KPIs, so design them with care
* The validity of the data used to calculate metrics schould be the major subject of your attention 


How to structure metrics

Metrics' tree
* Allows you to 

Customer journey - flowchart
* User is in the center of everything
* Works best in prosuct-based (or marketing-based) companies luke mobile maps 


Ecomerce example

Revenue - cost Where cost is another instance

ARPU - average revenue per user 

Flow of purchase 
AOV - average order value 

User Retention - production and 
User Acquisition - marketing 
Q&A:
Q: 

Government - for the life level of their citizens ( Why not liberty or something)

Q:How to create new ,metrics

A: We need set of metrics - can count only money in and money out
1. Look on what company do
CJM, Costs and instances if we have crosses we need to dissolve it 
 It's more complicate to understand if metrics is usefull for business than to create it 
 Minimise am out of crosses and company, costs and metrics  is covered by metrics

 A: 
 There is no real understanding of what especially this role means - it's differ from company to company

 Q: Market research  - ьгдешзду multiple source

\section{Second lesson}

\subsection{Presvvriptive}

Speaker Ivan Kornev


\begin{lstlisting}
profile = ProfileReport(df, title = "Pandas Profiling Reprot")
profile.to_file("output.html")
\end{lstlisting}



 Interactions - statictics about intersactions 

 Using densiti for that 

 for example dancebility and energy have some kind of correleation 


And heatmap

 And missing values 

 Q What is cardinality 

 High cordinality - lots of unique values 

 Alerts is useful to see if imbalance is occur ed, what distribution it could have(for example uniform) 

 It's not analytics it's use-full instrument to understand what data we have 


 What else can you Encounter in Raw Data:
 Gaps: For example missed city 
 Outliers: CartAdd for example lots of A2C. Could be bot of rival
 Incorrect entries: for example "7 млн" not 7 000 000 

 Main functions of Data Aggregation

 Sum
 Average
 Quantity

 Aggregation of aggregation data 

 Sensitivity of data is not a problem if you work in huge company 50+ analysts 


 Q How to make analyticall decision  

 Economic effectiveness 

 Send something via TG(e.g TG bot)
- opportunity to loss data (P)
- and how much data is cost (v)

P*V
Own server in company 
Cost to develop own infrastructure (C)


How to get a job - go on internship
Write about knowledge about analytical instruments 
Studential projects 
\subsection{Key-metrics}
know your user like you know yourself 

Client is key for success for company 

Ads in searcher(SEO), influencers, banners, CEO 
Budget -> Money we spent -> ad network 

Typical marketing funnel
Impression(first interaction ( unique users that see or views) -> click -> (Web-Landing -> Website) or (app-store -> Installation) 

Cost per installation (CPI) 
Cost per action (CPA)
We want returning purchase and again, and again, and again 

Lots of intermediate steps to make purchasee(e.g Basket -> Delivery -> Check Out) 

Another example: 
Subscription-based application 

Customer jorney map 

UE(user engagement) -proxi metrics for hour revenue type 


Cash gap


Retargeting 

ROAS = Return on ad spend = Expected Revenue / Maeketing Spend 

Resume and lists of metrics
Impressions - Ad view
Clicks - ad clicks
CTR - conversion from view ro click
CPI/CPL
CPA
ROAS(ROI) - our ability t earn back the money spent on ads

lead - when user come to syte

Share of organic traffic anong the new users
Retarrgeting - our ability to bring back people who churned sometime in the past
Non-direct advertising - TV, YT, offline-services 


Duolingo maximised DAU, but DAU have connection with Revenue 

Look on marketing mix modeling how to model marketing channels 
(organic user went from something not just from nothing)


Product 

Conversion
* multiple target actions
Retention
* it often makes sense to calculate retention to target action 

Product analytics is built from the target events

Cohort-based analysis

\section{Third lesson}

Dashboard is needed to create data that is readable for final users

Develop analytical decisions (grafana, Power BI), web servers(monitoring promo activities)

In the beginig time you need is multiplied by 5


Dashboard is combination of graphs,tables and so on, name viz

DataSets is needed to make viz. To create viz aggregation( is commonly used)

\subsubsection{Useful types of viz}
Factoid 
Lines
Tabled(useful for operations e.g what products isn't bought)
Bar-charts
Areas
Staked areas(Time distribution) 

\subsection{PowerBI practice}

Data importing
CSV, Excel, DB, Internet, JSON

\subsection{Financial metrics}
Metlov Dmitry


Financial Metrics and Analysis 
For reporting and reports

Management vs Financial Reporting

Top-line metric structure
Revenue - costs = profit

Revenue other Services: 3pl, Rent, Platform
Other services

Costs Supply Chain is rising important to monitor it to have good unit economics 
IT - services, salaries, 


Allowances - lost items(our "prohet")



Key drivers 

Items -> GMV -> Posting


GMV money that we accumulate in some way 

Metrics
AIV = average item value
IPP =items per posting
AOV
Items per posting needed to understand utilities 

Key revenue metrics and ratios

Sales Comissions Platforms

GP -gross profit (sum of all revenue streams)  
Margin = GP/GMV
Contribution (gp-costst) is it valuable for us to sell item 

CPI - cost per item = cost/items
CPL - sot per liter = cost per liter
CPP - cost per posting = cost per posting

When to use what?
